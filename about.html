            <h2>My Journey...</h2>
          <p>My schooling has been a journey that has led me through a series of subjects. With every class,
            I learned what I did and didn’t like, and progressed from there. This journey took me through
            two Bachelor’s Degrees, one concentration, minor, certification, and apprenticeship before
            finally landing me in a place where I feel “right”.</p>
            <h2>From Health...</h2>
            <p>
            My undergrad experience at UC Berkeley
             centered around healthcare, but interning experiences showed me that the health care industry
             didn’t match up with my work environment goals. From there, I took my background in math and science
              to a completely new field – computer science.</p>
              <h2>To Computer Science...</h2>
              <p>
              This second degree was a change and a different
              sort of challenge. I earned the degree online so I felt myself being disconnected from peer and
              teacher support – a departure from my first degree at a traditional university. To maintain a
              sense of balance, I taught science at elementary schools in the afternoons. I found that the
              interaction made me feel more fulfilled from day to day. My final project for my computer science
              degree was a mobile application. I developed the front end and enjoyed it so much that I decided
              to take a course in Swift mobile development after graduation. Creating websites and applications
              had always sounded so intriguing to me, but this course left me feeling slightly unfulfilled. I realized
              that what I wanted was to create the visual aspects of these applications and to work with others,
              while incorporating my coding skills.</p>
              <h2>To Design and Development...</h2>
              <p>
              I sat down at a café and typed my goals into a search engine.
              I took down a list of different job titles and programs, and in the next few days had narrowed the
              list down to one program – Bloc UI Design and Front-End Development. This program had me excited
              to do my work, and had me finally feeling like my work was “right”. I love building a beautiful,
              clean interface that pulls the user in but doesn't affect the usability of the application.</p>
              <h2>To Life Outside of Work.</h2>
              <p>
              When I'm not wrapped up in pixels and programming, I love staying active by hiking, running,
              or going to fitness classes. I'm an avid traveler and live music seeker, and am always up to
              try a new restaurant. I thrive on exploration.</p>
