      <h2>First of all, what is Brightboard?</h2>
      <p>Brightboard is an application that allows a user to create simple note documents,
         store images, save links to websites, and collaborate and share with other users.
         The application features the ability to add or edit, view and organize, and share content.
         There is also collaboration functionality that makes the application interactive. Brightboard
         strives to find the balance between professional and personal content storing, and make
         the application fun for all uses.
       </p>
    </div>
    <div class="challenge">
      <h2>So what's the challenge for Brightboard?</h2>
      <p>The challenge is to differentiate the application from the
        similar ones on the market already. I needed to identify any hole left by other applications and
        make Brightboard stand out in those areas. To do this, I researched the competitors and surveyed
        potential users.
    </div>
    <div class="goal">
      <h2>How does Brightboard achieve this goal?</h2>
      <p>Brightboard will aim to be like a personal assistant application - organizing and keeping ideas, inspirations,
        and relevant information that can be used personally or with friends and colleagues. Brightboard will have the ability
        to share to social media and store information seen on social media, but not be a type of social
        media directly. Brightboard will have the ability to store work-related information and collaborate with colleagues,
        but not be just another sterile work application. Brightboard will take on a more colorful palette and
        have more visual elements than the researched competitors.

    <h1>User and Competitor Research</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="usersurveyscontent">
    <p class="explanation">
      In the beginning stages of my Brightboard research, I looked into potential competitors and questioned
      potential users. I noted the features the competitors did and did not have, as well as the feel and design
       of their interfaces. I then surveyed multiple users to get a feel of what applications
      they use for content storing, and what they like or are lacking from applications on the market.
      Together, this research provided me with a solid foundation to build upon. From the user research,
      three users exemplified the overall responses and thoughts shared by my survey respondents. These users
      also validated some of my own findings from the competitor research.

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      </div>
    <p>
      A good representation of the range of competitors include Dropbox, Evernote, and Pinterest.
      For notes, users report using Microsoft Word, a desktop tool, or a simple post-it. For images and links,
      they bookmark on their browser, or use Facebook or Pinterest. Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive are used
      almost strictly for professional reasons for files like PDFs. Interestingly, four of the six specifically
      mentioned applications have a blue and white color palette. In terms of application functionality,
      there did not appear to be an application that fell in-between the professional applications
      like Box and Google Drive and the applications for fun, personal use like Facebook and Pinterest. It became clear
      that none of the users used an all-encompassing application to store notes, images, and links in one
      place. This is the void that Brightboard is trying to fill.

        <p>
          Most of the files Melissa uses for work stay locally on the office computer,
          and can be easily accessed and shared by her co-workers in the office.
          She is a new mom and is in the process of looking to buy a house, so most
          of her bookmarking is used for personal reasons. Melissa enjoys crafts so
          she uses Pinterest to save and organize that sort of content. Outside of Pinterest,
          her content gets easily lost or forgotten about since she bookmarks on her browser
          or jots down notes. She wants a clean, organized space because clutter makes
          her feel overwhelmed and makes the task not worth it.

        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p>
          Jaclyn is a consultant who works full-time hours but not in an office setting. All of her work
          is shared over the internet to be approved, viewed, or edited. Her work can’t be done on
          small devices such as a phone or laptop, but she might occasionally want to access content
          on them in case something comes up while she is away from home. She doesn’t often save personal
          content, so her focus is on a tool that would benefit her work life, with reliability and
          security being key. She has a lot of work content, so she needs storage space and a great way
          to organize everything into folders. Jaclyn also would like an application that notifies her
          when a collaborator has viewed her shared content.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">“I work remotely, so sharing my work and relevant files is absolutely crucial.
          Knowing that my content gets shared reliably and securely is very important to me.”

        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p>
           Lisa is a new designer who is trying to collect a gallery for inspiration and for quick work
           references. She is constantly being inspired by content and getting ideas that she needs to
           quickly jot down. These ideas can come to her at any time, so she needs a tool that is accesible
           on any device. She also enjoys the old-school idea of writing notes and ideas free-form, and
           crossing things off manually from her lists. She would love a tool that is quick to pull up
           and feels like she just pulled a journal out of her bag to put down ideas for later reference
           and sharing.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">“I love the convenience that technology allows in terms of portability and
           content organization. I also love the authentic feel of free-form journaling. The combination
           of the two would be wonderful!”

        <h2>Logo</h2>
        <p>
          The Brighboard logo concept went through iterations based of the thought of the “bright ideas”
          that the user is storing in the application. The concept of a light bulb representing the ideas
          came up early and stuck through most of the logo iterations. I found it easy to incorporate
          into the Brightboard name and the roundness of the bulb fit with the round curvature of the chosen font.

        <h2>Color Palette</h2>
        <p>
          In researching color palettes, I chose one that could be described as fun and professional
          to match the intended personality of Brightboard. Brightboard needed some accent colors
          that go along with the “bright” concept but that were not too intense or distracting.

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>
          For the fonts, I chose one serif and one sans serif. For my sans serif font, I was searching
          for a geometric and clean font. Montserrat offers rounded letters, with the “o” being a perfect
          circle. The font feels modern and not overly formal. I used the "normal" weight in the font to get
          a feel that was not too light or too overbearing for these larger headlines. My serif font Roboto Slab matches the
          geometric feel of Montserrat. It puts a modern twist on serif by using slab serifs to grab
          the user’s attention to the bits of descriptive text used in Brightboard.

        I did a preference test to survey users about what screen made more sense to them to "add"
        links, notes, and images. The users were able to view three screens that were similar
        aside from the look and placement of the "add" feature. Interestingly, the results were almost
        exactly split between the three screens. One screen had slightly more votes at 36%, and was also
        my preferred screen, so I chose this version.

      <h2>How did I achieve my goal for Brightboard?</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the Brightboard project was to create a unique application, both in terms of functionality
        and appearance. A main component to differentiating Brightboard from content sharing competitors was to
        replace the sterile interface with one that had a more colorful, inviting appearance.
        <br><br> I selected a color palette that had more than one color, and made these colors vibrant yet unobtrusive.
        I steered clear of the blue and white palette used by many content sharing applications.
        The palette selected was professional, fun, and matched the concept of theBrightboard brand name.
        My branding for Brightboard took clean, geometric lines and paired those with a lightbulb
        and thought bubble shape to create a relevant logo that can be recognized when separated from the
        brand name. The interface layout focused on making the content very clear and organizable for any level user.
        My layout design is intuitive for the user and makes key features, like adding content, easily visible.<br><br>
        The result of this work is an application that stands apart from the competitors in both functionality
        and design. Brightboard fills a gap in the market and offers a user experience that is not seen in other
        major applications available today.
